SalaryPackaging Caculator
=========================
This is a simple salary packaging calculator that calculates the net salary of an employee after packaging their salary. 

This is using 
	- .net core 8 MVC and Blazor.
	- frontend and backend validation.
	- strategy pattern for calculation.(overkill for this simple project, can be replaced by switch statement for DRY principle).

I didn't write unit test for this, because its not on requirement.
