# SalaryPackaging Caculator

- This is a simple salary packaging calculator that calculates the net salary of an employee after packaging their salary. 

- This is using 
	- [x] .net 8, MVC and Blazor.
	- [x] frontend and backend validation.
	- [x] strategy pattern for calculation.(overkill for this simple project, can be replaced by switch statement for DRY principle).
	- [ ] I didn't write unit test for this, because its not on requirement.
